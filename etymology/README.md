# Etymology Distribution Tool

This tool takes a given plaintext document and calculates the percentage distribution of etymologies for all words in the document. This is useful for determining the linguistic background of an author, or for establishing linguistic themes in works of fiction.

This tool makes use of the ISO-639-3 table, created by www.iso639-3.sil.org.

This tool makes use of the Etymological Wordnet, created by www.etym.org. This wordnet is contained in a file 'etymwn.tsv,' which is too large to be stored on GitHub without upgrading to GitHub LFS.
